<!-- Structure of Program -->

Stucture of programs is vary from language to language. But most of the structure are similar. example of c++ program is:
 <!-- preprocessor directive -->
 #include<iostream> 
 using namespace std;
// function declartion here
int main (){
  


return 0;
 } 





 <!-- indentation and coding conventions -->


 Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only like cpp but the indentation in Python is very important. its varies from lang to lang

 Coding conventions are a set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that language


input ==> Computer ==> Process ==> Output

 <!-- Program output -->
   When we run our program, it gives some output is called as program output.

<!-- Syntax rules -->
     Every language has its own set of syntax rules. e.g; semicolon is necessary in cpp and python does'nt.  

<!-- Common errors --> 
  Syntax error  (mistake in syntax)
  logical error (some logical error )  
  runtime error (occurs during execution.... suppose we give wrong input then the error will come is called as runtime error.)

<!-- Language keywords -->
    
   Keywords of language is also vary from lang to lang. e.g; "for" in c++
