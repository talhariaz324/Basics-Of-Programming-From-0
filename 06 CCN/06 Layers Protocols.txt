 Application Layer Protocols Include: 
    DNS, BOOTP, DHCP, SMTP, POP, IMAP, FTP, TFTP, HTTP


DNS (Domain Name System): DNS is a protocol used to resolve domain names into IP addresses. It is the system that translates human-readable domain names, like www.example.com, into IP addresses, like 192.0.2.1, that computers use to communicate with each other on the Internet.

BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol): BOOTP is a protocol used to assign IP addresses to network devices during the boot process. It is typically used by diskless workstations to obtain an IP address and other network configuration information.

   a "diskless workstation" refers to a computer system that does not have a hard drive or other local storage. Instead, these systems rely on network-based storage to provide access to operating systems, applications, and data.

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): DHCP is a protocol used to dynamically assign IP addresses to network devices. It is used to simplify the process of configuring network devices, as it automatically provides the necessary configuration information, such as IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways.

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): SMTP is a protocol used to send email messages between servers. It is the most commonly used protocol for email transmission on the Internet.

POP (Post Office Protocol): POP is a protocol used to retrieve email messages from a server. It is typically used by email clients to download email messages to a local computer.

IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol): IMAP is a protocol used to retrieve email messages from a server. It is similar to POP, but it allows users to keep messages on the server and access them from multiple devices.

FTP (File Transfer Protocol): FTP is a protocol used to transfer files between computers on a network. It is commonly used to transfer files between a client computer and a server.

TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol): TFTP is a simpler version of FTP used for transferring files between network devices. It is typically used for booting diskless workstations and for firmware updates on network devices. 
   TFTP is commonly used in situations where a small, simple file transfer protocol is needed, such as in network boot processes for diskless workstations or for updating firmware on network devices. 
   Firmware is software that is embedded in a hardware device, such as a computer motherboard, network router, or smart phone, to provide low-level control of its functions. Firmware is typically stored in non-volatile memory, such as ROM or flash memory, and is designed to be retained even when power is turned off.
   Firmware performs essential functions in a hardware device, such as controlling the device's boot process, managing its hardware interfaces, and providing low-level access to device-specific features and resources

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): HTTP is a protocol used to transfer data over the World Wide Web. It is the protocol used by web browsers to request and receive web pages from web servers. These data is actually the hyper text pages. So WWW interlinked with the hyper text pages which are build with HTML.
And these pages are available over the network.



                                                   Transport Layer Protocols Include:  UDP, TCP

     
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that provides a lightweight mechanism for sending datagrams (or packets) between networked devices. UDP is often used for real-time applications, such as video or audio streaming, where speed and low latency are critical. Unlike TCP, UDP does not provide reliability or error correction mechanisms, and packets may be lost or delivered out of order. However, this also means that UDP can be faster and more efficient than TCP in certain situations.
            Connectionless mean that sender sends packets to the receiver without knowing he is active or not.
            Misconception: was that sender dont know the receiver and sends in the air. Because it is connectionless. But I was wrong.
            Example: Video Call


TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between networked devices. TCP is often used for applications that require reliable and accurate transmission of data, such as file transfers, email, and web browsing. TCP establishes a virtual connection between devices and uses a system of acknowledgments and retransmissions to ensure that data is reliably delivered and received in the correct order. TCP is generally slower and more complex than UDP, but it is also more reliable and offers better error detection and recovery mechanisms.  

         TCP/IP is that's why called because we use TCP protocol in Transport layer and we use IP protocol in network layer.


 

   


                                   Internet Layer Protocols include: NAT, ARP, ICMP, RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, BGP



Network Address Translation (NAT): 
ON SEND:
When device req to router then it has private IP address and random PORT number. BUT router change with public IP address and assign unique PORT number and req to ISP's.
ON BACK:
When a response comes from the server, Network Address Translation (NAT) is responsible for translating the server's IP address and port number to the appropriate private IP address and port number of the device within the local network. 

DETAIL: Every Computer which is connected to the router have the local(private) IP address by the router.
But the ISP gives the global(public and unique) IP address to the router,, and when we request then router uses NAT to give the public address to our private address and with that, requests to the respective server.
    NAT gives the public address to the devices which are requesting to the router by using the one public IP address which was assigned to the router by the ISP.
    How NAT give particular data to the device even using same public IP address?
    NAT assign the unique and temporary PORT number to the each request. So identify using this PORT number and keep the record within the NAT table so that it can identify the each device because every request has the same public IP address (of router).
    NOTE: This PORT number which is assigend to the request by the router in the NAT process is different from the the PORT number which has the application or process within the computer. This NAT assigend PORT is temporary.



Address Resolution Protocol (ARP): ARP is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses. MAC addresses are physical addresses associated with network interface cards (NICs) on devices. ARP helps in identifying devices on the same local network by resolving IP addresses to MAC addresses, which are used for data link layer communication.

      MAC-to-IP Address Resolution: Devices on a local network communicate using MAC (Media Access Control) addresses, which are unique identifiers associated with network interface cards (NICs). However, higher-level protocols, such as IP (Internet Protocol), use IP addresses to identify devices. ARP is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses, enabling devices to communicate with each other at the data link layer.

      Local Network Communication: ARP allows devices on the same local network to communicate with each other. When a device wants to send data to another device with a particular IP address, it uses ARP to determine the MAC address associated with that IP address. This MAC address is then used to send the data to the intended recipient on the local network.



Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP): ICMP is used for network management and error reporting. It includes features such as ping, traceroute, an`d error messages that help in diagnosing network issues. ICMP is used by network devices to communicate information about network status, connectivity, and errors, which can help in determining the best path for data.



Routing Information Protocol (RIP): RIP is a distance-vector routing protocol that determines the best path for data based on the number of hops (intermediate network segments) between devices. It uses a hop count metric to calculate the shortest path to a destination network. RIP is a simple routing protocol commonly used in small to medium-sized networks.




Open Shortest Path First (OSPF): OSPF is a link-state routing protocol that calculates the best path for data based on the shortest path algorithm and the state of network links. OSPF exchanges information about the network topology among routers, and each router builds a map of the network. Using this map, OSPF calculates the shortest path to a destination network based on link costs, network congestion, and other factors.



Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP): EIGRP is a Cisco proprietary routing protocol that uses a combination of distance-vector and link-state algorithms to determine the best path for data. EIGRP calculates the metric for determining the best path based on factors such as bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load.



Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): BGP is an exterior gateway routing protocol used in large-scale networks, such as the Internet, to determine the best path for data between autonomous systems (ASes). BGP uses a path vector algorithm and exchanges routing information between routers in different ASes to determine the best path based on policies defined by network administrators.        
    Autonomous systems (ASes) refer to collections of IP networks and routers under the control of a single organization or entity that has a common routing policy. An autonomous system is typically assigned a unique Autonomous System Number (ASN) by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to uniquely identify it on the Internet.

   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used to exchange routing information between autonomous systems (ASes) in large-scale networks, such as the Internet. BGP determines the best path for data based on policies defined by network administrators in each AS. BGP allows autonomous systems to make independent routing decisions based on their own policies, which may include factors such as preferred paths, load balancing, and policy-based routing. BGP plays a critical role in interconnecting different autonomous systems on the Internet and ensuring efficient and reliable routing of data between them.                             



                                          NETWORK ACCESS protocols include: PPP, Ethernet, Interface drivers


PPP: PPP stands for Point-to-Point Protocol, and it is a data link layer protocol used in computer networks for establishing a direct connection between two nodes or devices over a serial communication (transfer of one bit at a time) link. It is typically used in situations where a point-to-point link needs to be established, such as connecting a computer to the Internet via a modem.

   Example: Real-time example: When you use a dial-up modem to connect to the internet, PPP is used to establish the connection between your computer (PPP client) and your Internet Service Provider's (ISP) modem (PPP server). PPP frames are used to encapsulate the data transmitted over the connection, ensuring its reliable and secure transmission. Also provide services for the transmission of data.

WHY PPP even we have session layer (for session establishing) and transport layer (for transmission)?
While session and transport layer protocols handle many aspects of data transmission, PPP serves a specific purpose in establishing and maintaining point-to-point connections, providing additional functionalities such as connection establishment, data encapsulation, link quality and error detection, and network address assignment, which may be required in certain network scenarios.


Ethernet: Ethernet is a widely used data link protocol that operates at the Network Access layer of the TCP/IP stack. It provides a way to transmit data over a local area network (LAN) using a set of rules for handling data frames, including addressing, collision detection, and error correction. Ethernet is used in wired networks and supports various data rates, such as 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, and beyond.
Real-time example: In a corporate office, Ethernet may be used to connect computers, printers, and other devices in a local network. When a user sends a file from one computer to another, Ethernet frames are used to encapsulate the data and transmit it over the Ethernet LAN to the destination device.


Interface drivers, also known as network interface controllers (NICs) or network interface cards, are hardware devices that provide the physical connection between a computer or a device and the network medium. Interface drivers translate data between the computer's internal data format and the format required by the network medium, such as electrical signals for Ethernet or modulated signals for a telephone line.
Real-time example: When you connect your computer to a wired Ethernet network using an Ethernet cable, you are using an Ethernet interface driver (NIC) installed in your computer. The interface driver handles the conversion of data between your computer and the Ethernet network, allowing you to transmit and receive data over the network.
