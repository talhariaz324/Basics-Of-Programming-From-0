TCP/IP model is the implementation of the OSI model.
OSI model was the concept and TCP/IP model is implementation.

TCP/IP model has 4 layers or some say 5 layers (breaking network layer into data link and physical layer) but we go with 4

1- Application Layer
2- Transport Layer
3- Internet
4- Network Access


In each layer include multiple protocols that we will discuss later. But for now lets discuss what each layer do


1- Application Layer 
    Combination of the OSI application, presentation and session layer.
    Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control
    

    Protocols Include: DNS, BOOTP, DHCP, SMTP, POP, IMAP, FTP, TFTP, HTTP

2- Transport Layer
    Process to Process communication
    Support communication b/w diverse devices across diverse networks


Protocols Include:  UDP, TCP

3- Internet

    Determines the best path throgth the network


Protocols Include: NAT, ARP, ICMP, RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, BGP



4- Network Access
    Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network
    Means physical, and the network and data link layer actually media for which network established

    Protocols Include: PPP, Ethernet, Interface drivers


    Protocol Data Unit: are named according to the protocols of the TCP/IP suite:
        Application Layer -- data
        Transport Layer -- Segment
        Network  -- Packet
        Data Link -- Frame
        Physical -- bits
