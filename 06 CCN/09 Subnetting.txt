Subnetting: When we have to do the division of the main network then we use the subnetting which gives different networks by dividing the same main network. Actually we use it in classless because main ip address may lose more IP addresses so we divide it into more small networks and use each network by losing small number IP addressses instead of large.

Procedure:
1) Identify the class for the IP address to which you are going to make subnetting and also get its default subnet.
2) Convert its subnet into binary
3) Note the required number of host need per sub network and find the subnet generator and octet position of this.
4) Create the subnet
5) Create the ranges of each small network (which get from the big network)


Example: Subnet the IP address 196.10.20.0 into 52 hosts in each subnet(subnetwork)

Solution:
1) Class is C and the default subnet is 255.255.255.0
2) Binary of default subnet is 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
3) 52 hosts are needed. So for getting SG and its octet we need few sub steps
            1) Binary of (host needed) here,, 52   ---- Binary of 52 is 110100 (here may have some leading 0's but always ignore them and right the binary where from the 1 occur)
            2) Count the binary bits and reserve those bits into the binary of default subnet (by starting from right to left)
                    And reserve means just those bits would be 0 else would be 1 because we learn that consective 1 and consective 0. 
                Here, 6 bits so subnet of default becomes:
                    11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 (So reserve the 6 bits and make remaining 2 also 1)
            3) Now from right to left if we see then look for the first 1 occurence and get its decimal value and that decimal value would be SG and the octet in which it occur would be the octet position
                Here, 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
                Get that particular octet, 1    1   0   0   0   0   0   0
                                           128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1 

                So the first 1 occur at 64 so the SG is 64 and this occurenece is within the 4th octet

4) New subnet would be the addition of the decimal values of where 1 occur in the octet position.
    Here, 4th octet and 1 occur at: 64 + 128 = 192 so the last octet was for the host in default subnet so, new subnet is:
        255.255.255.192 /26 where /26 show the number of  1 bits in our final binary subnet 

5) Ranges start from the IP given in the question and the next range starts from the  addition of SG here, 64:

1) 196.10.20.0 -- 196.10.20.63
2) 196.10.20.64  -- 196.10.20.127
3) 196.10.20.128  -- 196.10.20.191
4) 196.10.20.192  -- 196.10.20.255

This whole make the total of IP addresses as the default subnet but now we divide them into small networks.
Each range can communicate within itself hosts using switch 
But one range cant communicate with other range using switch because now the network change based on the subnet 255.255.255.192

Similarly each range has first address for the netwrok and the last address for the broadcast address of the network.
