Subnetting: When we have to do the division of the main network then we use the subnetting which gives different networks by dividing the same main network. Actually we use it in classless because main ip address may lose more IP addresses so we divide it into more small networks and use each network by losing small number IP addressses instead of large.

Procedure:
1) Identify the class for the IP address to which you are going to make subnetting and also get its default subnet.
2) Convert its subnet into binary
3) Note the required number of host need per sub network and find the subnet generator and octet position of this.
4) Create the subnet
5) Create the ranges of each small network (which get from the big network)


Example: Subnet the IP address 196.10.20.0 into 52 hosts in each subnet(subnetwork)

Solution:
1) Class is C and the default subnet is 255.255.255.0
2) Binary of default subnet is 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
3) 52 hosts are needed. So for getting SG and its octet we need few sub steps
            1) Binary of (host needed) here,, 52   ---- Binary of 52 is 110100 (here may have some leading 0's but always ignore them and right the binary where from the 1 occur)
            2) Count the binary bits and reserve those bits into the binary of default subnet (by starting from right to left)
                    And reserve means just those bits would be 0 else would be 1 because we learn that consective 1 and consective 0. 
                Here, 6 bits so subnet of default becomes:
                    11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 (So reserve the 6 bits and make remaining 2 also 1)
            3) Now from right to left if we see then look for the first 1 occurence and get its decimal value and that decimal value would be SG and the octet in which it occur would be the octet position
                Here, 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
                Get that particular octet, 1    1   0   0   0   0   0   0
                                           128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1 

                So the first 1 occur at 64 so the SG is 64 and this occurenece is within the 4th octet

4) New subnet would be the addition of the decimal values of where 1 occur in the octet position.
    Here, 4th octet and 1 occur at: 64 + 128 = 192 so the last octet was for the host in default subnet so, new subnet is:
        255.255.255.192 /26 where /26 show the number of  1 bits in our final binary subnet 

5) Ranges start from the IP given in the question and the next range starts from the  addition of SG here, 64:

1) 196.10.20.0 -- 196.10.20.63
2) 196.10.20.64  -- 196.10.20.127
3) 196.10.20.128  -- 196.10.20.191
4) 196.10.20.192  -- 196.10.20.255

This whole make the total of IP addresses as the default subnet but now we divide them into small networks.
Each range can communicate within itself hosts using switch 
But one range cant communicate with other range using switch because now the network change based on the subnet 255.255.255.192

Similarly each range has first address for the netwrok and the last address for the broadcast address of the network.



Different scenrios for SG:
    Maybe the SG become in the third octet then again start count that octet acc to table. and determine the SG

For Example: You get the SG 2 in the third octet then ranges of networks would be:
Supoose Given Ip was 150.15.0.0

150.15.0.0              Ending 150.15.1.255 Because the next starting is 150.15.2.0 so we come till 1.255 
add SG at their octet
150.15.2.0  here not 150.15.0.2 because we are in third octet and so the 2 of third octet is actually allow the 512 are hosts alloed so we have to jump of 2... Ending would be 150.15.3.255

150.15.4.0 150.15.5.255
150.15.6.0 150.15.7.255
150.15.8.0 
    SO on until the actaul ip get to end.




Another case: 128 is SG and starting IP is 10.0.0.0

10.0.0.0       Ending 10.0.0.127
add 128 
10.0.0.128          10.0.0.255 becasue next start after this 
add 128 = 512 so we dont write 512 instead we make it 0 and add 1 to previous octet
10.0.1.0    10.0.1.127
10.0.1.128  10.0.1.255
10.0.2.0    10.0.2.127





Troubleshooting: For Example we have given with the host which has IP and Subnet.
But it unable to communicate with the other hosts of its network so we have to troubleshoot this.

We will be given with the IP and its subnet.
                                            192.168.1.127 and subnet is 255.255.255.224
SOlution:
    We convert its  subnet into the binary    11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000 so SG is 32
    Get the SG  32
    Make the network range.
            192.168.1.0 192.168.1.31
            192.168.1.32 192.168.1.63
            192.168.1.64 192.168.1.95
            192.168.1.96 192.168.1.127 Here our IP.
            192.168.1.128 192.168.1.159
    Check weather the IP which is given to the host neiher a network address nor a broadcast address.
    If it is then we identify the problem

        So our problem is that our host has the IP address which was for the network broadcast that was the problem 


Troubleshoot No:2 
Solution:
    1- Convert the subnet into the binary
    2- Get the SG
    3- Make the ranges
    We found that host IP addresses was not netwrok address and not a broadcast address. Then what is the reason?
    Reason was that Host belong to other network and the gateway belong to some other network. and we are communicating them using the switch. So here is problem.

    Change the host IP to the same network of the gateway is the solution

    
    For finding the network address of the given IP
    Solution:
        You can use above method and the the IP range, first address would be the network address.
        2nd Method:
            Take binary of given Ip
            Take binary of given subnet
                Do And operation on them
            Result is in binary and convert into decimal
            This is your netwrok address

            FOR EXAMPLE IP: 25.34.12.56/16 then its subnet mask is of 255.255.0.0 because this binary has 16 bits for network 


    For Finding the broadcast address of the given IP 
         You can use traditional as above method and the particular IP range, last address would be the broadcast address.
         2nd Method:
            Take binary of the given IP
            Take binary of the given subnet
            Take 1's complement of the subnet Binary
                Do the OR operation with the binary of IP and the complemented binary
            Result in binary and convert into decimal and this is result


        Example: An organization using class B for its 64 departments. But now to do the classless so give the subnet for this.
        Solution: 
            Here we have to make network of 64 departments (not here hosts dependend,, here network dependend)
            Step 1: Take binary of the Class B subnet 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000
            Step 2: Now we need netwrok for 64 department means 2^6. so we need 6 bits to reserve in the default subnet binary
            Step 3: 11111111.11111111.11111100.00000000 Here note that we reserve bit from left not right because here we are preparing based on the network not the host. So the reserve bits should be consective with netwrok side.
            Step 4: Convert into the decimal and that is yours subnet
