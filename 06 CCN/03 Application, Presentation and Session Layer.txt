Application Layer: It enables the user to access the network resources.
-- This is the application through which data would be generated and send to other node.

Services:
1- File Transfer and Access Management (FTAM) -- may send and receive
2- Mail Services -- mail send and receives
3- Directory Services -- Provides access of the data globally.

For Example: I Have to send the password to the other node. Then I open the whatsapp (app), write the password and send. Here maybe i upload some file to send.


Presentation Layer: It is concerned with the syntax(format)  and semantics(meaning of that format. Means what first 8 bits represent) of the 
information exchanged between two systems.

Services:
1- Translation -- Converting the information into common format that is understandable by sender and receivers as well.
2- Encryption -- Make the information unreadable by changing its format etc so that nobody except reciever ( by decrypt) can read this information.
3- Compression --  Reducing the number of bits of info to send

For Example Continue: Password is transfer to common format, encrypted and compressed. So maybe password is qwerty and now skfduawjsh



Session Layer: It establishes, maintains and synchronizes the interaction among
communicating devices.

Services:
1- Dialog control -- Sending means two processes are going to communicate so this layer enables the dialog among 2 nodes
2- synchronization -- And also sync the sending and receiving. For example you have data of 2000 lines. So make checkpoint at every 100 lines
that this data send or not. If not then resend.
