OSI model: The purpose of the OSI model is to facilitate the communication
between differnet systems without requiring changes to the logic of the
underlying hardware and software.


Layering: Layering means decomposing the problem of building a network into
more manageable components (Layers).

    - More modular design amd easy to troubleshoot.

Layers in the OSI model:
    - Application Layer
    - Presentaion Layer
    - Session Layer
    - Transport Layer
    - Network Layer
    - Data Link Layer
    - Physical Layer

Router: is parse the data and have a look on the ip of sender and receiver. So sends the data to the particular node.
Router Layers: 
    - Network Layer (This layer parse sender and receiver)
    - Data Link Layer
    - Physical Layer

 Sender                                                                                  Receiver
    ------------------------------------------- Router ------------- Router ----------------          
Application (prepare the data to be send)                                         At here same layers but            
Presentaion                                                                       from physical to application
Session
Transport (important)
Network                                        
Data
Physical
