/*
Characteristics of Computer Networks is to provide:
1) Fault Tolerance ==> chosse other path if first one has problem withput losing data
2) Scalability ==> after adding more computers in existing network without having affect in performance
3) Quality of Service (QOS) ==> Quality of service mean to provide priorties, suppose a router get two request, one is real time
communication and other is the email sending. then QOS ensure to give priorty to real time phone call
4) Security ==> Security is to prevent data from unauth persons, 
When we send our data, data is not in our hands now, attacker can access the router where from data is going and misuse the data
while we can fix it by changing the shape of data and only readable by the reciever.
