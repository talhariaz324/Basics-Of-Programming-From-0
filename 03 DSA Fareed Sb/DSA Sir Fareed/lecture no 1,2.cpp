/*
You can find the slides in lecture 1 and we discuss all about that.

/*
Similarly, In second lecture we discuss about the parameters which decide performance of algorithm
indentation, less lines of code, comments, unnecessary comments avoidance etc are the part of good algorithm
but there are 2 more things which affect the user of the app, above things does not effect the the user.
TIME and SPACE....
We can say we use stop watch but we cant press in nano seconds
We can say that we use system time before and after call but this will be only for one input type. and can vary from computer to computer.
But above solution of system call is only valid after implementation. which is not good case. as we have to judge before implementation
and the before and after time should more close to each other.
For this purpose we use performane analysis and measurment.
Analysis: Before implentation
Measurement: After implementation
