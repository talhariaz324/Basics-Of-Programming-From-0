Quiz:
All done by me with little mistakes.
1- Call by value means new copy so it will not have impact on passing one.
2- Large number of calls cannot be trace using tracing so we make a table
table includes from smaller value.
for example: search for f(5);
Then instead directly search for 5 we have to search 1 then 2 and.... 5
