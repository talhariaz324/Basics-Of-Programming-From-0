/*
What is Data Structure and Algorithm?
Program is a set of instructions to solve a problem.
Instructions work with data.
How to manage data in the memory?
To manage data in the memory we use Data structure.
Two Types:
1) Physical Data Structure 
    Array     | 
    Matrices  |  These will tell how the data will be place in the memory.
    LinkedList|

2) Logical Data Structure
    Stack   |
    Queues  |
    Trees   |   These will tell how to utilize/use that data.
    Graph   |
    Hashing |


Algorithm: are the bigger part.
Everything has algorithm. So here
we are going to discuss the algos of
the data structure.
We will do it later after it.



Recursion:
Problem solving is the major thing.
It is depend on the mathematics.
Mathematics is recursion 1st.

Sorting:
Also we will do all the sorting algos.


Analysis:
Time complexity is also important.
So we are also doing it with the 
starting lectures.
