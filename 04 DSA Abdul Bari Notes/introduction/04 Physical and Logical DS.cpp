/*
Physical and Logical Data Structure

There are actually two types of data structures:
1) Physical Data Structure
2) Logical Data Structure

Physical Data Structure:
These are structures that organize data in memory. Basic Physical Data Structure are 2:
    1) Array 
    2) LinkedList
Array: Array store data in memory in consecutive location in memory. Array can be in stack and can be in heap.
Array is used when we know the size of data that we want to store in memory.

LinkedList: LinkedList is pure dynamic. It always store data in heap memory. Its pointer which usually name is head is in stack.
LinkedList has nodes and each node is connected to other through pointer.


Logical Data Structure: are those which are implemented on the each physical data structures or combination of both. These allow how to insert and delete in memory data.
Logical Data Structures are:
1) Stack  (LIFO) |   Linear
2) Queue  (FIFO) |   

3) Tree  | Non- Linear
4) Graph |       

5) Hash Table  | Linear or Tabular
