/*
Array ADT means abstract data type. which means it is collection of 
data representation and the operations on that.
Data representation is by the compiler.
Operations are defined by us.

Data:
1) Array Space
2) Size
3) Length (No of elements)

Operations:
1) Display 
2) Add(x)
3) Insert(index, x)
And there are more such like that which we are going to discuss in next
lectures.


1) int A[10] // on stack and fix size. Now it has space and size as well.
length gives how many elements are inserted till now into the array.

2) int *A;
/ Take size from user
A = new int[size]; // dynamic on heap. 
So it also has space and size. and again length gives size of array.
