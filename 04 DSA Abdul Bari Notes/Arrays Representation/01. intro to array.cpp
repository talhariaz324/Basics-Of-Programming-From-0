/*
You can go for Sir Fareed for more on the arrays.

Simple variables are the scalars
Array is the vector

Baisc array get space in stack.
It size can be given compile time and runtime as well.
But once the size given, it cannot be extended.
Simple
A[5] = {1,2,3,4};

But in heap creation we use new keyword.
This will make the array on heap which can grow.
We can access it using pointer.
