/*
Computer is for running the program.
program is used to solve problems.
Now, For execution computer has to give memory and other resources of hardware.

OS is intermediary between the user and hardware.
Deep Defination is that resource allocator.
For this resource allocation we have some problems like how to handle multiple process.
How to handle other process while previous is already running.
So all these things are actually directly handle by the OS.

There are some concepts of OS which we will discuss:
1) CPU Scheduling
2) Memory Management... etc.

NOTE:
I/O burst and CPU burst:
CPU burst: is the time when process is using the CPU
I/O burst: is the time when process is using the Input or reading a file etc.
