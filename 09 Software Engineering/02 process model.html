    There are some traditional software process models
    1) Waterfall model
    In this model we have same SDLC steps. We have to complete one first then we move on next one. There is no way back that is why we call 
    it as waterfall model. We can use it only when we very clear requirement from the customer.
    2) Incremental model
    This model is similar to waterfall but it has increments. Each increment is like waterfall we can't come back. We priortize the requirement from the 
    customer and the do the priortized requirement in the first increment. Then we move on next increment. In case customer want some
    changing in the increment no 1 then we can update the change in increment no 2. And so on.
    3) Prototyping model
    We use this model when we are not clear requirement from the customer. We can make a prototype (rough software without proper design etc)
     of the requirement containing ambiguites.
    4) Spiral model
    The spiral model is a combination of waterfall and iterative development process with emphasizing on more risk analysis. we also do verification
    Using the Spiral Model the software is developed in a series of incremental releases. Unlike the Iteration Model where in the first 
    product is a core product, in the Spiral Model the early iterations could result in a paper model or a prototype. However, during later 
    iterations more complex functionalities could be added.


   Above are the traditional software process models.

   But there are some new software process models.
   => Agility process contain: 
Rapid and adaptive response to change
Effective communication among all stakeholders
Drawing the customer onto the team
Organizing a team so that it is in control of the work performed
Yielding … (mean changing can be occur) 
Rapid, incremental delivery of software
    
=>are responsive to changes during project development 

recognize that project plans must be flexible 

eliminates the separation between customers and developers 


=> emphasizes importance of rapid delivery of operational software and de-emphasizes importance of intermediate work products 


Agile principles:
1) Customer involvement throughout the process
2) Incremental development (incremental delivery with some functionality)
3) People, not process (In traditionl model, model decides the deadline while here it is done by people)
4) Embrace change 
5) Maintain Simplicity (don't focus on the design phase.... focus on the development phase and then deliver incrementally) 

Those models who will be fulfull the above agile principles then we can say these are agile software process models.
1) Extreme programming (XP)
2) Scrum

Both model follow the above agile principles but with some diffrent termonologies and a little change.

XP                                    Scrum

1)Increment                            1) Increment called as Sprint
2)User Stories (Documentation          2) Product backlog (user stories called as product backlog)
of requirement then we convert 
it into proper tasks)
3) 15 Days after increment             3) 30 Days after increment   
4) nill                                4) Daily Scrum (mean daily meating of developer team beacuse its increment a little bit large then XP. Stakeholder may attend as listeners, but are not required to do only as long as it is useful to the Development Team.)
5) Pair Programming (one developer     5) nill
more sit with actual developer
for cross check.)     


Disadvantages of agile process:
=> It require the customer throghout the process. If customer not available then it will be difficult to move.
=> Poor resourse planning.
