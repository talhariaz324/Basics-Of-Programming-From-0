<!-- 
    Today i am going to start software engineering
 => Everywhere is software nowadays.
 => Why engineering in software?
    Ans: Usally, when we make something with the help engineering its failure reates are too low.
    Software without engineering going to face most of the time failure rate. SO that we use engineering in it.
    Its systamatic, discipline and quantifiable through the process of software development,operations and maintenance.
    we use it in whole development lifecycle of software.

    => Clear the requiremetns first in order to move to design because without design we can't move to coding.
    => Do documentatoion, from scratch.
    => Cross check the requirement with the customer when you write them on documentaion and then move to design.

=> In almost most of the software requires the quality software mean: 
   => Should be reliable (For example: In missles, we use software. these software should be reliable OTHERWISE we they can cost us most.)) 
   => Complete
   => Should be easy to use
=> SE helps to deliver system on time and complete with reliabilty.
