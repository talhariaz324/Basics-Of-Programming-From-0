// Simple member function
Simple member functions are the functions which are simple as we did before in the class.
*/



/*
// Static member function
Static member functions are those which can access only the static member variables.
*/




/*
// Const member function
Const member functions are those which dont allow the function to modify the member variable or member function.
*/




/*
// Friend  function
Friend functions are actually not the part of the class. They are simple outside function. But when we want from that function to access
the private member variables of the class then we make that particular function friend of the class by just using friend keyword.
*/



/*
// Friend Class
Similary we can make functions of other class friend to the first class.
But what if we have many functions then we make the whole class as friend of the first class.
